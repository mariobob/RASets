# Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Cheaters Paradise (Subset)
**Platform:** PlayStation 2

| Set meta info | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Number of achievements | 73 |
| Total score | 120 |
| Game ID | 2772 |
| Subset type | Bonus/Challenge |

## Subset concept
This subset celebrates GTA: San Andreas's legendary cheat code system. Instead of punishing cheaters, we reward creative, chaotic, and skillful use of cheats. Every achievement requires activating specific cheats and accomplishing challenges that would not be possible in vanilla gameplay.

**Philosophy:** Cheats are part of what made San Andreas iconic. This subset turns cheat codes into achievement challenges.

## Subset plan key

## General caveats
* **This is a SUBSET** - All achievements require cheat usage. The main set prohibits cheats.
* Achievements track across save/load - cumulative tallies persist (kills, explosions, etc.)
* Survival challenges (marked ⏱️) require continuous conditions - dying or disabling cheats resets progress
* Some cheats **cannot be turned off** once activated (Pedestrian Riot, Peds Attack)
* Memory addresses are based on the PS2 NTSC version
* Rich Presence displays cheat usage count, wanted level, and money
